/**
 * Centralized query key factory for TanStack Query
 *
 * This follows TanStack Query best practices for query key management:
 * - Hierarchical structure for easy invalidation
 * - Type-safe keys with `as const`
 * - Single source of truth for all query keys
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Automatic request deduplication (same key = same request)
 * - Easy to invalidate related queries
 * - Consistent key structure across the app
