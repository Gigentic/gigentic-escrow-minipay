# Gigentic Escrow
## Product Requirements Document v1.6

### üéØ Executive Summary

Gigentic Escrow is a decentralized escrow protocol built on Celo, designed for secure peer-to-peer transactions in emerging markets.

    WALLET --> FACTORY
    FACTORY --> ESCROW
    API --> KV
    API --> SELF
    ESCROW --> CELO
```

### Core Components

1. **Smart Contracts**: Factory pattern for deploying individual escrow instances
2. **Web Application**: Next.js-based interface with wallet integration
3. **API Layer**: Minimal backend for admin functions and verification
4. **Storage**: KV store for off-chain data (verification status and documents)
5. **Identity**: Self Protocol integration (frontend trust signal with no smart contract enforcement)

## üîÑ User Flows

### Primary User Journey

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Connect Wallet] --> B{Verified?}
    B -->|No| C[Optional: Verify Identity]
    B -->|Yes| D[Create/View Escrows]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Manage Escrow]
    E --> F{Dispute?}
    F -->|No| G[Complete Transaction]
    F -->|Yes| H[Admin Resolution]
    H --> I[Funds Released]
    G --> I
```

### Key User Actions

1. **Create Escrow**: Specify recipient and amount in cUSD
2. **Complete Transaction**: Depositor releases funds to recipient
3. **Raise Dispute**: Either party can dispute with reason
4. **View Status**: Check escrow state and details
5. **Verify Identity**: Optional trust enhancement via Self Protocol

### Admin Actions

1. **Monitor Disputes**: View all active disputes
2. **Review Evidence**: Access dispute reasons and party details
3. **Resolve Disputes**: Decide fund distribution
4. **System Monitoring**: Track platform metrics
